# Setup

# Problem 1
#

# Sets the temp of each node in the tree T
# ... to the size of that subtree
def calculate_size(T):
    # Set the temp for each node in the tree
    # The return value is up to you
    
    # Your code goes here
    pass



#
# Problem 3
#

# Outputs a subtree subT of T of size in the interval [L,U] 
# ... and removes subT from T by replacing the pointer 
# ... to subT in its parent with `None`
def FindSubtree(T, L, U): 
    # Instructions:
    # Implement your Part 2 proof in O(n)-time
    # The return value is a subtree that meets the constraints

    # Your code goes here
    pass
