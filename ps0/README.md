# Problem Set 0

## Overview

This problem set explores program basics (recursion) and graph basics at the level of CS 50 and CS 20.

## Running the Code

The problem set includes some starter code in `ps0.py`. To run the code, type in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m ps0
```

## Running the Included Tests

The problem set also includes some tests for you to test your code. In the submission of a graded problem set, there are also tests that are run for grading. 

**Note:** Passing all included (local) tests does not necessarily mean your code is correct, or that you will get a 100%, but it is a good start. Do your best to check base cases, corner cases, and robustness on your own.

To run the tests, type in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m ps0_tests
```
